# Which Resume?

I have two active resumes at the moment - a generic all encompassing Robotics resume (`robotics-resume`), where I try to convey the breadth of what I've worked on - including recent coursework for deep learning, computer vision, and robotics related classes.

I also have a Full Stack (`full-stack-resume`) that is focussed only on node.js and full stack experiences, as well as my general experience of creating node-controlled devices.
